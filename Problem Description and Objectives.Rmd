Though there is no real "problem" here, automated identification of fruits could prove to be actually useful as some sort of a business application/utility. For example, one may be on the brink of inventing some sort of machine which automates the process of sorting fruits. One can readily imagine that having software to see the image and classify it would greatly help this hypothetical invention.

To provide a sort of background, image classification is a popular and exciting application of machine learning which allows a model to "recognize" certain images. It recognizes these images by being fed tons and tons of "training data", and being coded to make decisions based off what it "sees" in the image about what the image is. This model is then to be tested to see how accurate it is at classifying images. Somewhat counter-intuitively, 100% accuracy is not desirable because this is referred to as "overfitting". This means that an analysis corresponds too closely to a particular data set which means it can fail to fit additional data or fail to classify future image data.

The goal of this project is to train a model so that it can sufficiently identify fruits from images. These classifications will be based off the dataset of images of various fruits and vegetables linked in the Data Description document. This model will be performing multiclass classification.
