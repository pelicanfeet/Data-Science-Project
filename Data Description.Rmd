The data set I have chosen for this project comes from https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki/
This data is a set of labeled image data of celebrities collected from IMDB and Wiki (but for now I will limit myself to only the ~1GB of data from Wiki's faces only dataset), and with the image data comes information scraped from their profiles about their age and gender. I plan to use this data to train a model to recognize whether an image of a person is a male or a female. I downloaded the data from the above link and it gave me a TAR file. After extracting the data from this file, it seems that it contains .jpg images in a tabular form.

### The variables are as follows:

* dob: date of birth (Matlab serial date number)
* photo_taken: year when the photo was taken
* full_path: path to file
* gender: 0 for female and 1 for male, NaN if unknown
* name: name of the celebrity
* face_location: location of the face. To crop the face in Matlab run
* face_score: detector score (the higher the better). Inf implies that no face was found in the image and the face_location then just returns the entire image
* second_face_score: detector score of the face with the second highest score. This is useful to ignore images with more than one face. second_face_score is NaN if no second face was detected.
* celeb_names (IMDB only): list of all celebrity names
* celeb_id (IMDB only): index of celebrity name
